Please add that file to the chat.

#### it will also give a smooth gameplay and and also reduces lag to maintain a stable connection while playing  

The changes you described will require edits to the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` constants.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update the logo description.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
